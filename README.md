The showcase application for [Spring Social Wunderlist](https://github.com/techdev-solutions/spring-social-wunderlist).

In order to get started just set `wunderlist.client.id` and `wunderlist.client.secret` in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

If you  haven't created an app just yet you can do it [here](https://developer.wunderlist.com/apps/new).

Once the properties have been set just run `./gradlew run` from within the application directory.

The application is accessible via `http://localhost:8080`.
